Thought I could live without it
Said I just didn't want to
Thought I could walk away
That wasn't true
Days they turn into lifetimes
Water it drips on a rock
What could be stronger in time
Than fears and thoughts

On your mark set go
On your mark set go

You can go far in denial
Fall right asleep on that train
Wake up and you don't recognize a thing
Days they turn into lifetimes
Water it drips on a rock

What could be stronger in time
Than our fears and our thoughts

On your mark set go
On your mark set go

Tomorrow never really comes now does it
It's always sailing up ahead
The SS Good Intention full of everything you said
You ever wanted,
Wanted

On your mark set go
On your mark set go
